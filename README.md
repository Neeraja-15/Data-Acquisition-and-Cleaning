# Data-Acquisition -and-Cleaning
**Data Acquisition** and **Data Cleaning**, two critical steps in any data analysis project. These steps ensure that the data is sourced correctly and prepared for analysis, modeling, or visualization.

## Data Acquisition
### Purpose
To collect raw data from a reliable source for analysis.

### Common Sources
- **Public Datasets**: Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, government portals (e.g., data.gov).
- **APIs**: REST APIs (e.g., Twitter API, OpenWeatherMap API).
- **Web Scraping**: Websites (ensure compliance with terms of service).
- **Databases**: SQL databases, cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).
- **Manual Entry**: Surveys, forms, or spreadsheets.

### Steps
1. **Identify the Source**:
   - Determine where the data is available (e.g., a CSV file, API, or database).
   - Verify the source’s credibility and relevance to your project.

2. **Download or Access the Data**:
   - For files: Download and save in your project directory (e.g., `./data/raw_data.csv`).
   - For APIs: Use a library like `requests` in Python to fetch data.
     ```python
     import requests
     response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
     data = response.json()
     ```
   - For databases: Connect using a library like `SQLAlchemy` or `pyodbc`.
     ```python
     import pandas as pd
     import sqlalchemy
     engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine('sqlite:///database.db')
     df = pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM table_name', engine)
     ```

3. **Document the Source**:
   - Note the source URL, access date, and any licensing requirements (e.g., attribution, usage restrictions).

### Notes
- Ensure compliance with data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) if handling personal data.
- Check for data freshness—older datasets may not reflect current trends.
- Save a copy of the raw data in its original form before cleaning.

## Data Cleaning
### Purpose
To prepare the raw data for analysis by addressing inconsistencies, missing values, and errors.
### Tools
- **Python**: For data cleaning.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation.
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations.
  - `datetime`: For handling dates.
### Steps
1. **Load the Data**:
   - Use `pandas` to load the raw data into a DataFrame.
     ```python
     import pandas as pd
     df = pd.read_csv('data/raw_data.csv')
     ```
2. **Inspect the Data**:
   - Check the structure, data types, and summary statistics.
     ```python
     print(df.head())  # View first few rows
     print(df.info())  # Check data types and missing values
     print(df.describe())  # Summary statistics
     ```
3. **Handle Missing Values**:
   - Decide how to address missing data (e.g., fill, drop, or impute).
     ```python
     # Fill missing numerical values with 0
     df['column_name'] = df['column_name'].fillna(0)
     # Drop rows with missing critical data
     df = df.dropna(subset=['critical_column'])
     ```
4. **Correct Data Types**:
   - Ensure columns have the correct data types (e.g., dates as datetime, numbers as integers).
     ```python
     df['date_column'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date_column'])
     df['numeric_column'] = df['numeric_column'].astype(int)
     ```
5. **Remove Duplicates**:
   - Drop duplicate rows to avoid bias in analysis.
     ```python
     df = df.drop_duplicates()
     ```
6. **Handle Inconsistencies**:
   - Fix inconsistencies like negative values in columns that should be non-negative.
     ```python
     df['numeric_column'] = df['numeric_column'].clip(lower=0)
     ```
   - Standardize text data (e.g., convert to lowercase, remove extra spaces).
     ```python
     df['text_column'] = df['text_column'].str.lower().str.strip()
     ```
7. **Export Cleaned Data**:
   - Save the cleaned dataset for further use.
     ```python
     df.to_csv('data/cleaned_data.csv', index=False)
     ```
### Notes
- **Data Quality**: Look out for outliers, inconsistencies, or errors that could skew analysis.
- **Domain Knowledge**: Use domain expertise to decide how to handle missing data or inconsistencies (e.g., filling missing sales data with 0 might not always be appropriate).
- **Documentation**: Keep track of cleaning decisions (e.g., why certain rows were dropped) for transparency.
### **Reflection**
This README is a general-purpose guide that can be applied to any data project, whether it’s for machine learning, business analytics, or visualization. It’s concise, with clear steps and examples, making it easy for someone to follow. I included practical Python snippets to illustrate the process, along with notes on common pitfalls like data privacy and quality issues. If you’d like to tailor this README for a specific type of project (e.g., machine learning, web scraping), or add more details.
